        <h2> OGUN STATE, NIGERIA</h2>
        <img src="images/ogunstate.jpg" alt="OGUN STATE, NIGERIA" width="400">
        <p> Ogun State is a state in southwestern Nigeria. It is bordered to the south by Lagos State and the Bight
            of Benin, to the
            east by Ondo State, and to the north by Oyo and Osun states while its western border forms part of the
            national border
            with the Republic of Benin. Ogun, state, western Nigeria, created in 1976 and comprising former Abeokuta
            and Ijebu provinces of former Western
            state, the latter carved out of former Western region in 1967. Ogun is bounded by Oyo and Osun states to
            the north,
            Lagos state to the south, Ondo state to the east, and the Republic of Benin to the west. It is covered
            predominantly by
            tropical rain forest and has wooded savanna in the northwest.
            Sodeke (Shodeke), a hunter and leader of the Egba refugees who fled from the disintegrating Oyo empire,
            founded about
            1830 a principality at Abeokuta in what is now the north-central part of the state. Most of the
            inhabitants of Ogun
            state are members of the Egba and Egbado subgroups of the Yoruba people.
            Agriculture, the economic mainstay of Ogun, produces rice, corn (maize),
            cassava (manioc), yams,
            plantains, and bananas.
            Cocoa, kola nuts, rubber, palm oil and palm kernels, tobacco, cotton, and timber are the main cash
            crops. The Aro
            granite quarries near Abeokuta, the state capital, provide building material for much of southern
            Nigeria. Mineral
            resources include limestone, chalk, phosphates, and clay. Industries produce cement, canned foods, foam
            rubber, paint,
            tires, carpets, aluminum products, and plastics. Abeokuta, an important market centre, is a terminus of
            the roads and
            railways coming from Lagos and other parts of the country. Major tourist attractions are Olumo rock,
            which according to
            tradition provided refuge for early Egba settlers; the Ake, the residence of the alake (the traditional
            ruler of
            Egbaland), built in 1854 and noted for its collection of antiquities and relics; and the Centenary Hall,
            all in
            Abeokuta. There are teacher training colleges in the state and a university of agriculture at Abeokuta.
            Area 6,472
