    Message of Peace
    Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to choose to be a
    peacemaker, now and always.

    Brothers and sisters, we can literally change the worldâ€”one person and one interaction at a time. How? By modeling
    how
    to manage honest differences of opinion with mutual respect and dignified dialogue this is cool.
