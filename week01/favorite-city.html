    <p> Salt Lake City was founded in 1847 by settlers led by Brigham Young who were seeking to escape persecution they
        had
        experienced while living farther east. The Mormon pioneers, as they would come to be known, entered a semi-arid
        valley
        and immediately began building an extensive irrigation network that could feed the population and foster future
        growth.
        Salt Lake City's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan, with the southeast corner of
        Temple Square
        serving as the origin of the Salt Lake meridian. Owing to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the city was
        originally
        named Great Salt Lake City; the word "Great" was dropped from the city's name in 1868.</p>
    <p>The Conference Center, in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the premier meeting hall for the Church of Jesus Christ of
        Latter-day
        Saints (LDS Church). Completed in 2000, the 21,000-seat Conference Center replaced the traditional use of the
        nearby
        Salt Lake Tabernacle, built in 1868, for the church's twice-yearly general conference and other major
        gatherings,
        devotionals, and events </p>
